### About the Visualization

This narrative visualization follows the structure of an interactive slideshow allowing the user to traverse the slides and look at different factors and their impact or non-impact on GDP.

### Data

The dataset used was derived from the World Development Indicators dataset from World Bank.

The original dataset contained over 1500 development indicators measured across 264 countries over a period of 56 years from 1960 to 2016.

However, for the purpose of this project, I considered only a subset of indicators related specifically to land usage and for a shorter time period: a decade from 2005 through 2015.


### Messaging

The intent of the narrative visualization is to provide information to the users regarding the impact of land usage or abuse on the GDP of various countries across the world.
The data used for the purpose of this project is from the [World Bank website](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators/)

### Narrative structure
This narrative visualization follows the structure of an interactive slideshow allowing the user to traverse the slides and look at different factors and their impact or non-impact on GDP.


### Scenes

There are six scenes in the narrative visualization. 
- The first screen gives a general overview of the project. We can start to navigate by clicking on the Begin the Journey link.

- The second screen is more about providing options to the user how he wants to navigate. Various links are provided in this screen that the user can use to navaigate.

- The user can select the Lets Find Out screen that provides a scatterplot of "Arable Land % & Rural Population Vs GDP" depicts the average GDP in US $ on the x-axis versus 
the average percentage of Arable Land along the Y-axis and the rural population as the size of the circles in the scatter plot.

- The user can select the Rural Population link from the above page to explore how much of the land area of major countries of the world is occupied by the rural population.

- The Rural Population screen provides a bar chart of average rural land area for the past 10 years across various countries depicts the various countries on the x-axis versus the rural land area in square kilometers on the y-axis.

- The user can click on the urban land area link in above page to get an idea of how big the land area is in various countries across the world.
The bar chart of average rural land area for the past 10 years across various countries depicts the various countries on the x-axis versus the rural land area 
in square kilometers on the y-axis.

- The user can click on the forest cover link to get an idea of the relation between forest cover and gdp. The line chart of average percentage of forest cover
for top 25 countries in terms of average GDP for the past 10 years across various countries depicts the years 1990 through 2015 on the x-axis versus the average percentage of forest cover on the y-axis

- The user can click on the Is it that then link which will take him to the last page of this visualization. 


### Annotations

The annotation on each screen is represented by the legend on the top where the message is conveyed in context to each screen. A tooltip is provided when 
mouse is hovered over different bars in the bar charts, stacked bar charts or on scatterplots. There is no tool tip mouseover for the line chart.
Labels are  provided along both x-axis and y-axis of each chart.

### Parameters

This section is hyper linked to the next section. The name of the target section is provided as a link in each screen. Some screens might have only 1 next section
while some other screens can choose between few screens. Also the user can select to start from the beginning. All navigation parameters are provided as hyper links.


### Triggers

Clicking the link takes the user to the next screen. The mouse click acts as a trigger event for navigation. The mouse hover (mouseover) event is a trigger 
for the tooltip in the bar chart, scatterplot and the stacked bar chart.
